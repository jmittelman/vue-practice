# Vue.js

I decided to learn how to work with Vue.js . I was interested in it because it is a lightweight and flexible way to make components and dynamically render it all with plain JavaScript objects.

## Cowboy Comments App

To practice with Vue.js I created a cowboy themed messaging app that includes comments by users that make up a conversation. Users can add a new comment in the form field at the bottom.

The app is not currently deployed but can be activated by running the comments.html file in this repo.

### Background

Vue was created by Evan You in 2013 after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects. He aimed to extract the parts that he really liked about Angular and React and build something smaller and more intuitive. It has a small but growing base of users today.

One of the best things about Vue.js is how it allows for easy code reusability. Components and Views are small, interactive parts of an app that can be esily integrated and appropriated.

Vue is an alternative to other frameworks such as React and Angular that also build web interfaces. Since it was built as a response to the advantages and disadvantages of those other frameworks, it is fresh and promising. Vue is generally less opinionated meaning it allows you to structure your app the way you want it to be instead of being forced to do things with certain restrictions.

###Important Concepts

There are a number of important concepts that are core to this technology that I learned about.

-Vue instance
The root of the application which can be plugged into an element of your choosing, forming a relationshiop between the instance and that portion of the DOM.
-Expressions
Expressions allow us to utilize existing data values, together with logic, to produce new data values.
-Directives
Command to conditionally render elements including ( v-if, v-else-if, v-else, v-show, v-for). If whatever is inside the directiveâ€™s quotes is truthy, the element will display.

###Impressions
The documentation for Vue is quite good and it seems that if you know other reactive frameworks, it should be very easy to pick up.

With vue it is easy to create components and assign attributes to html.

And, pleasingly, to use Vue.js, you can include it through a script tag in your html file. This means you don't have to install a space heavy package.

In my research and practice, I found some good resources for learning.
I consulted Vue's official intro tutorial course at [vuemastery.com](http://www.vuemastery.com) as well as a few other youtube videos and articles.
